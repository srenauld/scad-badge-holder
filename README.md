# Badge holder

This badge holder is designed to hold any CR-80 RFID badge when printed at 10.35% scale. It was designed to have the possibility to 
easily add a logo by subtraction in Blender (an example with the logo of the company I work for, SolveQ, is also present in this 
repository).

The SCAD file itself is parametrized and modifiable by messing with four variables identifying the card width, depth and thickness, 
and the thickness of the holder.
